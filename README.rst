Tornado-WebRTC
==============

Tornado app that can establish WebRTC sessions. Incidentally, that's what 
is says on the tin.

So yeah, for people who have no idea what WebRTC is; it's a realtime 
communications API for browsers. Open website, dial your friend, have fun.

And for people who roughly know how WebRTC works; this app:

#. provides a page with all required elements and scripts and
#. lets browsers (or even separate tabs) talk to each other via WebSockets 
   in order to connect peer-to-peer
